Interpolation of the Histogramed MR Brain Images for Resolution Enhancement

**Overview**

==>This project focuses on enhancing the resolution of MR brain images using interpolation techniques. The application is developed using Python and PyQt5, providing a graphical user interface for users to interact with different functionalities. This implementation is based on our research on image processing techniques such as Histogram Equalization, Adaptive Histogram Equalization, and Interpolation methods.

**Features**

Admin Login: Secure authentication for admin users.

Image Acquisition: Load and process MR brain images.

Low-Resolution Images: Display and analyze low-resolution versions of the images.

Histogram Equalization: Improve image contrast by equalizing histograms.

Adaptive Histogram Equalization: Advanced contrast enhancement technique using adaptive methods.

Interpolation: Enhance resolution using interpolation techniques to improve MRI clarity.

**Technologies Used **

Python 3.6+

PyQt5 (for UI)

OpenCV (for image processing)

NumPy (for mathematical operations)

SciPy (for interpolation methods)

**Installation**

1)Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Girisai3008/MRI-Resolution-Enhancement.git
cd your-repo-name

2)Install dependencies
